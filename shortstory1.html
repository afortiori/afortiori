<div class="text-dark"> 
<p dir="ltr">Beep. Beep. Beep. I hastily opened my eyes to a new day and the sound of my alarm. Thump. My warm feet hit the cold floor and instantly froze up. Bang. I shoved my door open and walked into my bathroom to start getting ready for school. Swish. I pushed the shades back on the window and looked out on the beautiful forest filled with tons of birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I looked in the mirror and saw my boring, long, straight brown hair and my average hazel eyes. I&acute;ve always hoped that I could be special in some way, but after awhile I accepted that I would always be normal and nothing special would ever happen to me. I took out my white toothbrush and got to brushing my teeth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While I was drinking some water, my eye twitched. I thought nothing of it and ran downstairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Creeeek. The bus door folded open for me.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As I jumped through the doors, my bus driver said:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&uml;Hi Amanda!&uml;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&uml;Hey Mr. Roberts! How are you today?&uml; I say back.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&uml;Great! Thanks for asking!&uml; he says in his deep voice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I nod and walk back to my seat and squeeze next to my best friends, Kristina Penski and Noah Ballato. I hear shouts of welcome all throughout the bus such as:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&uml;Williams!&uml;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Or &uml;Hey Amanda!&uml;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Before I could shout back, the bus jolted to a stop. I quickly looked past Kristina and Noah, to the window and saw a whole pack of moose crossing the road. It was almost never surprising to see wildlife because it was a daily routine. The earth is in good condition so the animals and plants are thriving. It was exceptionally beautiful that day because in between the frames of green there is a beautiful rainbow above the moose, almost painting a picture.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While looking at the pretty scene, my eye twitched.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was a boring room filled with desks, bulletin boards, and white walls. The only interesting part was the huge open windows that looked out onto the gorgeous forest. I sat next to the windows and I loved looking out at all the green trees, animals scurrying around, and sunlight filtering through the canopy of trees. I was in math class and trying to stay awake. My teacher, Ms. Smith, was explaining exponents to my class. Grumble. Rumble. I was getting hungry. Pop. Pop. Pop. I was cracking my fingers. Something fell out of my eye onto my jeans. The popping and grumbling stopped. I looked down and saw something that looked like a blob on my jeans. I picked it up and realized that it was a clear little bubble. It was like a droplet of water. Before I could look at it more, I realize that there was an orange hue coming from the windows. I looked up, and what I saw terrified me.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Time stopped. Through one eye I saw the lush forests but through the other eye I saw dead trees and animals perishing in the hot sun. It was like like a war had swept through the land killing everything in its path. I could see orange hot sands and an ocean just a few miles off, that was confusing because we live in Tennessee. I could feel the heat coming in through the windows and it made me sweat. This land I was looking at was dry, hot, unhealthy, and red. And I was the only one who could see it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I was confused. I was terrified. I was really, really hot. All I wanted to do was forget about this hot, red world. So I popped back the clear bubble into my eye. I felt it suction onto it. It took some blinking, but I was getting used to it. The orange-red glow faded away and the natural light and green trees came back. I looked around my seat at my friends. It seemed as if they didn't see anything like what I did, so I kept my cool and went on with my life.</p>
