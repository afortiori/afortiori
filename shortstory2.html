<div class="text-dark"> 
<p>Ember and Theo were walking down an uneven road. The moon was dimmer than usual because it was hidden behind clouds of smoke and dust. The curfew bells were about to ring and they both knew it was time to walk back. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s late,&rdquo; Theo said, &ldquo;we should go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ember frowns. &ldquo;You go ahead and I&rsquo;ll be back soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Theo sighed. &ldquo;It is dangerous to be out after curfew.&rdquo; He said halfheartedly. He already knew that she was going to do whatever she wanted. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo; She smiled at him and ran off into the shadows. </p>
<p>Ember waited for Theo to walk away. Once he was out of sight she climbed the wall of a nearby house. Theo wasn&rsquo;t wrong when he said that being out after curfew was dangerous. Everyone feared the deadly mechanical bees that wandered the streets after the warning bells rang. Supposedly if you were out after curfew then they could kill you. Ember knew that this was not always the case, the bees sometimes attacked an innocent. It was rare, but it happened. Ember shivered at the thought. She reached the top of the wall and climbed onto the roof. Traveling by rooftop was slightly safer than by road. The bees usually flew a few feet off the ground and rarely paid attention to what was above them. She still had to be careful though because if the bees figured out her location somehow they would swarm and she&rsquo;d be dead. </p>
<p>After walking for awhile she reached the wall of Innercity. In the daytime it shines gold, it&rsquo;s covered in intricate carvings, and it invites anyone to gaze at it and hope and dream. But when the sun goes down it looks dull and menacing. As a child she would dream about who lived inside Innercity. She was so sure that the people inside were beautiful and kind. She dreamed that one day someone from Innercity would take her into the city and she would live in a paradise. She knew better now. The people in Innercity may seem beautiful, but if they are anything like their wall, their beauty is nothing but an illusion and underneath it lies a monster waiting to show itself. Why else would they allow people to be controlled by cruel machines? Why else would they let children starve and freeze? Why else- a sound interrupted her internal rant. She soundlessly climbed down the roof and ducked into a shadow. She waited until she sensed something behind her and she slammed the body into the brick wall of a building. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth?&rdquo; </p>
<p>On the ground, unconscious, was a small girl perhaps twelve or thirteen. She had olive skin and sleek black hair that reached her shoulders. That wasn&rsquo;t the part that shocked her. There were plenty of orphans wandering the streets at night. She should know, she had been one. The surprising part was that she was wearing <em>very</em> expensive clothes and shoes that had actual pearls sewn into them. The sight of the pearls brought back memories that Ember didn&rsquo;t want to think about. Thankfully, she didn&rsquo;t have to because just then she heard a boy scream. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Luna!&rdquo; The boy had light brown hair and he was also dressed in expensive clothes. He looked about the same age as the girl on the ground, whose name must be Luna. She looked back at the girl at her feet. The pale moon that had just come out of the clouds gave her skin an eerie glow. Perhaps it was because she was unconscious, but Ember thought that she had a serene face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get away from her!&rdquo; the boy screamed</p>
<p>She sighed. If that boy kept on yelling like that she would have to knock out two children in one night. </p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop talking or you will get us killed by the bees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked confused &ldquo; What on earth is a bee and why would it kill us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>How could this boy not know about the mechanical bees that plagued this city? Unless...</p>
<p> &ldquo; You&rsquo;re from Innercity,&rdquo; she whispered, shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo; Umm, yeah. Can you get back to explaining this whole bee thing?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;The people from Innercity are monsters.&rdquo; she growled</p>
<p>His face darkened. &ldquo;Yup. Why do you think we tried to escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warning bells of curfew began to ring and Ember frowned. She needed to get back but she couldn&rsquo;t just leave these children. They&rsquo;d be dead in an hour. Especially since it looked like the poor girl had a nasty cut on her head. It was hard to be sure because the combination of her dark hair and the night sky made it hard to see any blood. The boy sat beside his friend and he looked like he was about to cry. Whatever caused them to run away from their perfect world, a world where children get fancy clothes and could walk outside whenever they pleased without fear, must have been bad. Ember knew what she had to do. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, we have to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked up, bewildered. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think that I&rsquo;d go anywhere with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, apparently they actually teach children some useful survival skills in Innercity. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friend needs help. You will both die in this city alone.&rdquo; she said, hoping that fear would get the child to come with her. She really didn&rsquo;t want the girl to die because of her. The boy considered her offer for a minute and eventually muttered a short, angry &ldquo;fine&rdquo;. She picked up the girl and began to walk. </p>
<p>&ldquo; Now,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo; normally I would climb onto the roofs and go home but I cannot carry a girl and climb at the same time, so we&rsquo;ll have to walk back on the ground. You&rsquo;re going to do exactly as I say unless you want-&rdquo; </p>
<p> &ldquo;-The bees to kill us I know, I know.&rdquo; The boy interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit.&rdquo; She muttered.</p>
<p>He heard her and scowled. They walked most of the way without incident. She actually believed that they were going to make it back with no problems. Oh, how she was mistaken. They were only a few blocks away when Ember heard the familiar buzzing and clicking sounds- and the tortured screams that followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry&rdquo; she said at his frightened expression &ldquo; it appears that they have chosen another victim tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She still made them hide in an alley until she was certain that the bees were gone. Once they had started walking again it wasn&rsquo;t long before they saw the body. The corpse was swollen and covered in sharp, metal stingers. The boy looked nauseous but to his credit he continued to walk normally. They stopped in front of an old, crumbling building that had definitely been on fire at one point. </p>
<p>&ldquo; What is this place&rdquo; He asked, disgusted. </p>
<p>&ldquo; Home sweet home&rdquo; She answered cheerfully.</p>
<p>When Ember opened the door Theo and Val looked at her in confusion and anger but without a word they carried Luna into a spare room. She remembered how she had met them. They were all orphans who were trying to survive on the streets. At first, they stayed away from each other but eventually they realized that it would be easier to work together. They&rsquo;d been friends ever since. </p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>&ldquo;Val will stitch up the girl&rsquo;s head wound&rdquo; Theo said carefully as he walked into the room. &ldquo;Anyone care to explain why there is an exhausted boy and an injured girl who are both not supposed to be here?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop talking about me like I&rsquo;m not listening! And I have a name don&rsquo;t call me the boy!&rdquo; the boy demanded. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; Theo asked patiently. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Casper.&rdquo; he said as he cautiously sat on an old sofa that looked like it was about to collapse. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Well Casper, Why don&rsquo;t you tell us why you are here.&rdquo; Val said as she walked into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo; Wait what about-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl is fine, she just needs sleep. Now talk.&rdquo; Val said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine but no interruptions till the end.&rdquo; Casper began his tale. &ldquo;Luna and I grew up in Innercity. We were always different from the other kids. We learned stuff we weren&rsquo;t supposed to. Lu -Luna&rsquo;s aunt had this room that was full of artifacts from before the Great War. We would play there and she would sh-show us the old objects and tell us stories. The wrong people found out and th-they-they- and she-she she never stood a chance. th-then-then-&rdquo; He was shaking and crying now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; Theo asked softly.</p>
<p>Ember was about to tell him to leave the boy alone but before she could speak Casper looked up and said:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Then we realized we had to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Casper was done speaking. He just looked off into space. Val and Theo looked at her. It was obvious that they wanted to ask her some questions but before they could say anything, a scream echoed around the room.</p>
<p> Apparently Luna was awake.</p>
<p>When Luna opened her eyes she was on a small bed with a bowl of oatmeal beside her. Her first thought was to eat the oatmeal. Her second thought was that something was wrong. She had never, <em>never,</em> even considered eating oatmeal. And then she remembered what happened. She remembered how they stormed into their sanctuary of old forbidden artifacts. She remembered how normal that day was before they dragged her aunt away. Luna gripped her stomach in pain. She felt like a weight was crushing her. The memory was too much. She must&rsquo;ve screamed because Casper and a handful of strangers burst into the room. She saw that Casper had been crying and she felt a stab of guilt. How could she just leave him alone in an unfamiliar city. She should have been smarter. The last thing she remembered was walking up to a girl to ask for help. They had just made it to the other side of the wall. They had no idea what was out there. Her parents had called this place Remnants because it was supposed to be a wasteland. It clearly was not. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good. You&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; A tall girl with cold eyes and dark hair pulled back in a ponytail said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>She</em> may be awake but the rest of us have been up all night. So let us sleep some before you start interrogating everyone Val.&rdquo; The person speaking was a short girl with fiery red hair and freckles. </p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ember is right. We all need sleep. Let's figure this out in the morning.&rdquo; A boy added. He looked at her.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m Theo. This,&rdquo; he said pointing at the read haired girl, &ldquo;is Ember and-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Val.&rdquo; The tall girl said. Luna realized that she did not like her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luna&rdquo; Luna replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well Luna, we&rsquo;ll all get some sleep and then we&rsquo;ll answer any questions you may have ok?&rdquo; Ember said kindly.</p>
<p>Everyone began to walk out. Except for Casper. He grabbed the pillow that she was using and dropped onto the floor. It was probably more comfortable than the bed anyway. Luna firmly believed that someone had stuffed rocks in the mattress instead of feathers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re ok Luna. Goodnight.&rdquo; Casper said </p>
<p>Luna was about to answer but Casper had begun to snore. So instead she whispered </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make sure we stay ok Casserole, I promise I won't leave you again.&rdquo; She thought he smiled at the old nickname but it was hard to tell in the dark. The silence drowned out her words as she stared at the ceiling. Luna did not think she was going to fall asleep. She had secrets that distracted her-secrets that she hadn&rsquo;t told a living soul. Somehow the darkness still managed to pull her in and she slumbered with the promise that tomorrow would bring answers resting in her heart. </p>
